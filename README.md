# 🧠 Project Nexus – ProDev Backend Engineering

Welcome to **Project Nexus**, a documentation hub for major learnings and practical experiences gained during the ALX ProDev Backend Engineering Program. This repository consolidates concepts, tools, challenges, and personal reflections, and serves as a collaborative bridge with frontend learners.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

* Document key learnings and skills acquired in backend engineering.
* Provide a structured summary of core backend technologies and concepts.
* Share real-world problems encountered and the solutions implemented.
* Highlight backend best practices and personal takeaways.
* Foster collaboration with ProDev Frontend learners through shared APIs and ideas.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Covered

### 👨‍💻 Programming Languages & Frameworks

* **Python**
* **Django** & Django REST Framework (DRF)
* **GraphQL** (using Graphene)

### 🌐 API Design

* RESTful API principles (CRUD, status codes, authentication)
* GraphQL schemas, queries, and resolvers
* API versioning and pagination

### 📦 Backend Essentials

* **Database Design**: PostgreSQL, normalization, migrations
* **Asynchronous Programming**: `async/await`, Django Channels
* **Caching**: Redis, in-memory caching, cache strategies (e.g., LRU, LIFO)
* **Authentication & Authorization**: Session-based, JWT, OAuth (Google login)

### 🔄 Communication & Queues

* **Celery**: Background task management
* **RabbitMQ**: Message broker for queue-based architecture
* **Webhooks** and **Signals**

### 🛠️ DevOps & Deployment

* **Docker**: Containerization of services
* **CI/CD Pipelines**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, automated testing & deployment
* **Environment Management**: `.env`, secrets handling
* **Static Files & Media**: Proper configuration for cloud/local serving

## 🔧 Real-World Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge                   | Solution                                  |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Handling long-running tasks | Implemented Celery with RabbitMQ          |
| Slow API performance        | Applied Redis caching and pagination      |
| Token expiration issues     | Introduced JWT refresh tokens             |
| Frontend CORS errors        | Enabled CORS handling via middleware      |
| API versioning              | Used DRF `DefaultRouter` + versioned URLs |
